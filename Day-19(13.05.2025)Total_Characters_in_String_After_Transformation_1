Problem Statement:
Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer t, perform t transformations on the string according to the following rules:

In each transformation, every occurrence of the letter 'z' is replaced by 'a' and 'b' (i.e., it splits into 'a' and 'b').

All other letters ('a' to 'y') are replaced by the next letter in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' → 'b', 'b' → 'c', ..., 'y' → 'z').

After performing t transformations, return the length of the resulting string modulo 
10
9
+
7
10 
9
 +7.

Stepwise Approach:
Step 1: Understand the Transformation Rules
'z' → 'a' and 'b': Each 'z' splits into two letters ('a' and 'b').

Other letters (a-y) → next letter: Each letter increments by 1 in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' → 'b', 'b' → 'c', etc.).

Step 2: Track Letter Counts Efficiently
Instead of modifying the string directly (which can be very slow for large t), track the count of each letter in the string after each transformation.

Use an array count[130] (covering all lowercase letters) to store the frequency of each character.

Step 3: Perform Transformations
For each transformation (t times):

Create a temporary array temp[130] to store the new counts.

Process letters from 'z' down to 'a' to avoid overwriting counts prematurely.

If the current character is 'z', increment temp['a'] and temp['b'] by its count (since 'z' splits into 'a' and 'b').

For other characters ('a' to 'y'), increment temp[ch + 1] by their count (since they transform into the next letter).

Update count with temp for the next iteration.

Step 4: Compute the Result
After t transformations, sum up all the counts of letters in count[].

Return the total count modulo 
10
9
+
7
10 
9
 +7.

Step 5: Edge Cases
If t = 0, return the original string length.

If s is empty, return 0.

Solution Code:
cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int lengthAfterTransformations(string s, int t) {
    int n = s.size();
    long ans = 0, mod = 1e9 + 7;

    vector<long> count(130, 0); // To store counts of each character (a-z)
    for (auto &ch : s) count[ch] += 1;

    while (t--) {
        vector<long> temp(130, 0);
        for (char ch = 'z'; ch >= 'a'; ch--) {
            if (ch == 'z') {
                temp['a'] = (temp['a'] + count[ch]) % mod;
                temp['b'] = (temp['b'] + count[ch]) % mod;
            } else {
                temp[ch + 1] = (temp[ch + 1] + count[ch]) % mod;
            }
        }
        count = temp;
    }

    for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
        ans = (ans + count[ch]) % mod;
    }

    return (int)(ans % mod);
}
Explanation:
Initialization:

We start by counting the frequency of each character in the input string s.

Transformations:

For each transformation, we process characters from 'z' to 'a' to avoid overwriting counts.

If the character is 'z', we split its count into 'a' and 'b'.

For other characters, we increment their next character's count.

Result Calculation:

After t transformations, we sum the counts of all characters to get the total length of the transformed string.

The result is returned modulo 
10
9
+
7
10 
9
 +7 to handle large numbers.

This approach efficiently handles the transformations by tracking letter counts, avoiding the exponential growth of the string length explicitly. The time complexity is 
O(t×26), which is optimal for large t.
