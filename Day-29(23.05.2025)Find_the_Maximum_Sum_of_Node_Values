Problem Statement: Maximum Value Sum After K Operations
You are given:

An array nums of integers representing the values of nodes in a tree.

An integer k.

A list of edges representing the tree's undirected edges (each edge connects two nodes).

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

Choose any node and apply XOR with k to its value.

However, there is a restriction:

If you perform the operation on one node, all adjacent nodes (connected by an edge) will automatically undergo the same operation in subsequent steps, propagating until no new nodes are left.

Your task is to compute the maximum possible sum of the node values after performing any number of such operations, following the given propagation rule.

Constraints:
The tree is connected and has n nodes.

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4

0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

0 <= k <= 10^9

Stepwise Approach
Key Insight:
Tree Structure & XOR Propagation:

Since the tree is connected and undirected, flipping (XORing) one node's value with k will eventually propagate to all other nodes due to the adjacency rule.

However, each XOR operation on a node toggles its value twice (once when directly flipped, and once when propagated back from neighbors).

Hence, each node's value can only be toggled (XORed with k) either 0 or 1 time (because toggling twice cancels out the effect).

Optimal XOR Decisions:

For each node, compare nums[i] and nums[i] ^ k.

If nums[i] ^ k > nums[i], it is beneficial to flip the node (add nums[i] ^ k to the sum).

Otherwise, keep the original value (add nums[i] to the sum).

Handling Odd Flips:

The total number of beneficial flips (canInc) must be even because each flip operation affects two nodes (due to propagation).

If canInc is odd, we must exclude the smallest loss (i.e., the smallest difference between a node's original and flipped value) to maximize the sum.

Algorithm Steps:
Initialize Variables:

ans = Total sum after making optimal XOR decisions.

minLoss = Smallest absolute difference between a node's original and flipped value (to handle odd flips).

canInc = Count of nodes where flipping increases the value.

Iterate Over Each Node:

For each node, compute nums[i] ^ k.

If flipping is beneficial (nums[i] ^ k > nums[i]):

Add the flipped value to ans.

Increment canInc.

Else:

Add the original value to ans.

Track the smallest loss (minLoss) between nums[i] and nums[i] ^ k.

Check for Odd Flipping Count:

If canInc is even, return ans.

If canInc is odd, subtract minLoss from ans (to balance the flip count).

Solution Code:
cpp
long long maximumValueSum(vector<int>& nums, int k, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    long long ans = 0;
    int minLoss = INT_MAX;
    int canInc = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if((nums[i] ^ k) > nums[i]) {
            ans += (nums[i] ^ k);
            canInc++;
        } else {
            ans += nums[i];
        }
        minLoss = min(minLoss, abs(nums[i] - (nums[i] ^ k)));
    }

    if(canInc % 2 == 0) {
        return ans;
    } else {
        return ans - minLoss;
    }
}
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes (since we process each node once).

Space Complexity: O(1) (constant extra space is used).
